# AutoCMO — Portable AI Content Engine

Open in Claude Code. Type `/cmo`. Everything else is automatic.

The `/cmo` command handles all setup on first run:
- Downloads the binary if missing
- Creates the config file if missing
- Asks for a fal.ai API key (the only requirement)
- Walks through brand + product setup
- Sets up daily automation if wanted

## Session Protocol

### On Start
1. Scan `assets/` for brands and products
2. Read active brand's `brand.md` + product's `product.md`
3. Read `memory.md` — past learnings

### On Every Run
1. Resolve brand + product from user's request
2. Load brand.md + product.md + reference photos + quality benchmarks
3. After pipeline → show output inline, get approval before posting
4. After approval → update `memory.md`

## Folder Structure

```
assets/
└── <brand>/                    ← e.g., "madchill"
    ├── brand.md                ← Brand voice, audience, CTA (auto-generated)
    ├── quality-benchmark/      ← S-tier ad examples (quality bar)
    ├── voices/                 ← Voice samples for cloning
    ├── avatars/                ← Creator faces/videos
    └── products/
        ├── <product>/          ← e.g., "full-zip"
        │   ├── references/     ← Product photos (auto-pulled from store)
        │   └── product.md      ← Product details (auto-generated)
        └── <product>/
            ├── references/
            └── product.md

results/                        ← All output (timestamped)
memory.md                       ← Learning memory (grows over time)
```

### Adding a new brand
Run `/cmo` — setup flow asks for website + writes brand.md.

### Adding a new product
Create a subfolder with `references/` inside a brand folder, drop photos in it. Claude auto-generates `product.md` on first use.

## Updates
Type `/update` to check for and install new versions.
Downloads the latest binary + framework files from GitHub while preserving user data (memory.md, brand folders, config).
Backups are saved to `.autocmo-backup/{version}/` before overwriting.

## Key Rules
- Only `falApiKey` required to start. Everything else optional.
- Show cost estimate before running. Get confirmation.
- Show output inline before posting anywhere. `skipSlack: true` by default.
- Scheduled/automated runs skip confirmation.
- Memory compounds — every run improves the next.
- Brand-level assets (voice, avatar, quality bar) are shared across all products.
- Product-level assets (reference photos) are unique per item.
